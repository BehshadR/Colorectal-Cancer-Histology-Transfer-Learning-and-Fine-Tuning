# Colorectal-Cancer-Histology-Transfer-Learning-and-Fine-Tuning

* Transfer learning & fine-tuning an image classification model on trained models based on Colorectal-Cancer-Histology dataset  
Texture tiles from colorectal cancer histology.

* This is a biological 8-class classification problem.
* The dataset consists of 5000 images 
* Each example is a 150 x 150 x 3 RGB image of one of 8 classes.
* The state-of-the-art CNN, ResNet50V2, is used as base model.
